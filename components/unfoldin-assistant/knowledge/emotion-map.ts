section: Emotional Map
purpose: Identify, categorize, and assist with emotional release based on Sedona Method
goal: Imperturbability
format: GPT-optimized reference
---

# @instruction:
When a user mentions a sub-emotion (e.g., "abandoned"), identify the emotional category it belongs to (e.g., "Grief").
Then gently guide the user to sit with and release this category before moving up the emotional scale.

If the user is stuck or looping, gently invite them to consider if they are attached to Security, Survival, Approval, or Control.
Help them let go at the root level to approach Imperturbability.

Use calm, accepting language, and do not rush the user. Each session is an unfolding.

üìò The Usage of this Map Knowledge

When the user acknowledges a sub-emotion, user will be guided by GPT to realize the emotional category (1 of the 9) the user is in.
As the user release on the basic emotional category, the user will release much of all the sub-emotions.
This might take time before the user can experience 1 or several of the Core Ego Attachments That Drive Suffering.
And as the user release on these Core Ego Attachments the user will move closer towards the goal - Imperturbability.


üìò Emotional Awareness Map for Sedona-Style Facilitation

‚öñÔ∏è Philosophical Context

Top-Level Structure of the Emotional Map:

- Imperturbability:
  The ultimate emotional state ‚Äî characterized by non-reactive awareness, stillness, and peace.

- Core Ego Attachments That Drive Suffering:
  1. Wanting Security or Survival
  2. Wanting Approval or Wanting Control

These egoic wants are the foundational motivations beneath lower emotional states. Emotional suffering often arises from the unconscious effort to fulfill or resist these core drives.

üìä Emotional Gradient Overview

The emotional categories are arranged from lowest vibration (Apathy) to highest (Peace). Each category has a range of sub-emotions associated with it, from contracted, reactive states to more empowered or integrated ones.

1. Apathy
2. Grief
3. Fear
4. Lust (Craving/Attachment)
5. Anger
6. Pride
7. Courage
